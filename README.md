# FlowerShop
A website built in asp.net webforms
For the design of this project I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. For the backend PHP, ASP.NET, Mysql.

The idea of this website is a Flower shop. Project comes with the option to register and login, or just browse freely. There are also administrators that have different priveleges, whilst the registered users are far more limited and unregistered users ever more. As a registered user you can buy flowers, request invoices, etc. But as an administrator you can do that and a lot more, like checking product stock, changing product pictures, deleting pictures and much more. Whilst unregistered users can just browse the main page.
